# Binary Search Trees

## What is a Tree

1. A data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship
2. Trees - nonlinear
3. Root - The top node in a tree.
4. Child - A node directly connect to another node when moving away from the Root.
5. Parent - The converse notion of a child.
6. Siblings - A group of nodes with the same parent.
7. Leaf - A node with no children.
8. Edge - The connection between one node and another.

## Where Trees use in applications

1. HTML DOM, JSON
2. Network Routing
3. Abstract Syntax Tree
4. Artificial Intelligence
5. Folders in Operating Systems
6. Computer File Systems

## Kinds of Trees

1. Trees
2. Binary Trees
3. Binary Search Trees

## How BSTS Work

1. Every parent node has at most **two** children
2. Every node to the left of a parent node is **always less** than the parent
3. Every node to the right of a parent node is **always greater** than the parent
