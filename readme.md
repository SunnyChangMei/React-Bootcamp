# The Modern React Bootcamp (Hooks, Context, Router & More)

* Learn React, from the very basics up to advanced topics like React Router, Higher Order Components and Hooks and the Context API.

* Build one massive capstone application, complete with drag & drop, animations, route transitions, complex form validations, and more.

* Learn the latest in React, including Hooks (my favorite part of React!).  We build a complete app using Hooks, including multiple custom hooks.

* Learn state management using the useContext and useReducer hooks, to mimic some of the functionality of Redux.
